### Try Our Sample Integration

This guide will help you get started with our Open API sample integration. Follow the steps below to clone the repository and run the sample code locally.

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

#### Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository from GitHub:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/buymed/open-api-integration-samples.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd open-api-integration-samples
```

#### Setup and Run Locally

Since the repository contains only `index.html` and `config.example.js`, you can run it locally using a simple HTTP server.

#### Using Live Server (Recommended)
If you have Visual Studio Code installed, you can use the Live Server extension:

1. Open the `open-api-integration-samples` folder in VS Code.
2. Install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) if you haven't already.
3. Right-click `index.html` and select **Open with Live Server**.




Then, open `hhttp://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html` in your browser.

#### Configuration

1. Rename `config.example.js` to `config.js`
2. Open `config.js` and update with your application credentials and configuration:

```javascript
{
  // Replace these values with your application credentials from Buymed Open Platform
  OAUTH_CLIENT_ID: 'your_client_id_here',
  OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET: 'your_client_secret_here',
  
  // Update this to your application's redirect URI
  OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI: 'http://127.0.0.1:5500',
  
  // These URLs should remain unchanged
  OAUTH_AUTH_URL: 'https://thuocsi.vn/oauth/authorize',
  OAUTH_TOKEN_URL: 'https://api.buymed.com/iam/core/v1/oauth/token',
  OAUTH_API_URL: 'https://api.thuocsi.vn/api/v1',
  
  // Use the approved scopes from your application on Buymed Open Platform
  OAUTH_SCOPE: 'pharmacy:order:read pharmacy:profile:read'
}
```

:::important
- `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`: Get these from your application details page on Buymed Open Platform. See [API Credentials Guide](./credentials.md) for detailed instructions on obtaining and managing these credentials.
- `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI`: Your application's callback URL
- `OAUTH_SCOPE`: Use the scopes that have been approved by admin for your application on Buymed Open Platform. You can view your approved scopes by:
  1. Log in to [Buymed Open Platform](https://open-apps.buymed.com/)
  2. Go to "Apps" section
  3. Select your application
  4. In the application details, the "Permissions" section lists all approved scopes

:::tip Security Note
Never share or expose your Client ID and Client Secret. Learn about security best practices in our [API Credentials Guide](./credentials.md#security-best-practices).
